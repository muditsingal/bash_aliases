SSH key config:

1. Create a .ssh folder in home directory (if not already present):
mkdir ~/.ssh

2. Paste this in the ubuntu terminal, choose .ssh folder to save the keys with appropriate file name (e.g. id_rsa). Remember your pass phrase:
ssh-keygen -t rsa -b 4096 -C "your_email@example.com"

3. Add ssh key to ssh agent:
eval $(ssh-agent -s)
ssh-add ~/.ssh/id_rsa

4. Copy ssh key from id_rsa.pub file and paste it into github -> SSH and GPG keys -> Add new SSH key. Give appropriate title.

5. Check your setting by:
ssh -T git@github.com

If you get:
Hi <username>! You've successfully authenticated, but GitHub does not provide shell access.

Then, congratulations! You have passed the test.


Debugging: 
If you have messed up and have multiple ssh keys like me:
ssh -i ~/.ssh/your_key_file -T git@github.com

If the above works, then you can be saved by adding the below lines in config file of .ssh:

nano ~/.ssh/config

Paste the below lines:
Host *
  IdentityFile ~/.ssh/your_default_key
